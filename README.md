# VM-Series Active/Passive HA on Google Cloud

This tutorial creates a pair of Active/Passive VM-Series firewalls on Google Cloud.  This deployment model provides solutions for the following key use-cases:

* Maintaining session continuity through stateful failover between the VM-Series firewalls.
* Terminating IPsec tunnels directly to the VM-Series firewall through the external load balancer.
* Preserving the original client IP address for internet inbound traffic to internal applications protected by the VM-Series firewalls.

The autoscale architecture is recommended in most use-cases.  Please see [VM-Series on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/partners/palo-alto-networks-ngfw) for more information on VM-Series deployment models.


## Architecture

In this model, each VM-Series firewall belongs to an unmanaged instance group. Only the primary VM-Series firewall receives network traffic from Google Cloud load balancers. The health check configured on the load balancers determines the HA state of the primary VM-Series firewall. If the health check fails on the primary VM-Series firewall, the load balancers carry the active sessions to the secondary VM-Series firewall. At that point, the secondary VM-Series firewall becomes the primary firewall.

> [!NOTE]
> During a failure event, sessions are carried to the secondary firewall through [connection tracking](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/network/networklb-backend-service#tracking-mode) on the load balancers.

| Resource | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- | 
| **VM-Series** | <ul><li>2 x VM-Series are deployed to separate zones within a region.</li><li>Each firewall belongs to an unmanaged instance group.</li><li>Each instance group is a backend service of an internal load balancer.</li></ul> |
| **External LB** | An external pass-through load balancer with two forwarding rules:<ul><li><b>Rule 1:</b> Forwards internet inbound traffic to the VM-Series untrust interface.</li><li><b>Rule 2:</b>Forwards outbound traffic from the untrust interfaces to the internet.</li></ul> |
| **Internal LB** | An internal pass-through load balancer with a single forwarding rule.  Traffic from workload networks use the load balancer's forwarding rule as the next hop within their VPC route table. | 

The following table describes the purpose of each VPC network. 

| VPC Name | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Mgmt VPC** | Contains the VM-Series MGT interfaces.  This interface also serves as the HA1 interface. |
| **HA2 VPC** | Contains the VM-Series HA2 interfaces. |
| **Untrust VPC** | Serves as the internet gateway for resources within the trust VPC. | 
| **Trust VPC** | Contains the workloads protected by the VM-Series.  This VPC can also serve as a hub network with multiple VPCs peered to it. |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> After deployment, the load balancer's health checks will only pass on the **active** VM-Series firewall.  This is because the dataplane of the passive firewall is inactive and is unable to pass the health checks.  During a failure event, the passive firewall becomes active and the health checks will pass. 

## Prepare for deployment

1. Enable the required APIs, generate an SSH key, and clone the repository. 

    ```
    gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
    ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/vmseries-tutorial -t rsa
    git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/google-cloud-vmseries-ha-tutorial
    cd google-cloud-vmseries-ha-tutorial
    ```

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file.

    ```
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

3. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and set values for the following variables:

    | Variable      | Description                                    |
    |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `project_id `     | Set to your Google Cloud deployment project.                                     |
    | `public_key_path` | Set to match the full path you created previously.                               |
    | `mgmt_allow_ips`  | Set to a list of IPv4 ranges that can access the VM-Series management interface. |
    | `prefix`          | (Optional) If set, this string will be prepended to the created resources.       |
    | `vmseries_image_name`          | (Optional) Defines the VM-Series image to deploy.  A full list of images can be found [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/11-0/vm-series-deployment/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-on-google-cloud-platform/deploy-vm-series-on-gcp/use-custom-templates-or-the-gcloud-cli-to-deploy-the-vm-series-firewall).       |

4. (Optional) If you are using BYOL image (i.e. `vmseries-flex-byol-*`), the license can be applied during deployment by adding your VM-Series authcode to `bootstrap_files/authcodes`.
5. Save your `terraform.tfvars` file.


## Deployment
When no further changes are necessary in the configuration, deploy the resources:

1. Initialize and apply the Terraform plan.  

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

2. Enter `yes` to start the deployment.
   
3. After all the resources are created, Terraform displays the following message:

    ```
    Apply complete!

    Outputs:

    EXTERNAL_LB_IP     = "ssh paloalto@1.1.1.1 -i ~/.ssh/vmseries-tutorial"
    EXTERNAL_LB_URL    = "https://1.1.1.1"
    VMSERIES_ACTIVE    = "https://2.2.2.2"
    VMSERIES_PASSIVE   = "https://3.3.3.3"
    VMSERIES_SSH       = "ssh admin@1.1.1.1 -i ~/.ssh/vmseries-tutorial" 
    ```

## Access the Active VM-Series Firewall

To access the VM-Series user interface, a password must be set for the `admin` user.

> [!CAUTION]  
> After the apply completes, it may ~10 minutes for the VM-Series to become available.

1. SSH to the *active* VM-Series firewall using the `VMSERIES_SSH` output value. 

    ```
    ssh admin@1.1.1.1 -i ~/.ssh/vmseries-tutorial"
    ```

2. On the *active* VM-Series, set a password for the `admin` username. 

    ```
    configure
    set mgt-config users admin password
    ```

3. Commit the changes.

    ```
    commit
    ```

4. Enter `exit` twice to terminate the session.


## Test the Deployment

You can now test the deployment by accessing the `workload-vm` that resides in the trust VPC network.  All of the `workload-vm` traffic is routed directly through the VM-Series HA pair. 

1. Use the output `EXTERNAL_LB_URL` to access the web service on the `workload-vm` through the VM-Series firewall.

    <img src="images/web.png" width="500">

2. Use the output `EXTERNAL_LB_SSH` to open an SSH session through the VM-Series to the `workload-vm`.  
    ```
    ssh paloalto@1.1.1.1 -i ~/.ssh/vmseries-tutorial
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The address within `EXTERNAL_LB_URL` & `EXTERNAL_LB_SSH` is the `inbound` forwarding rule on the external load balancer.  The VM-Series inspects and translates the request from the `inbound` forwarding rule to the `workload-vm`. 


3. On the workload VM, run a preloaded script to test the failover mechanism across the VM-Series firewalls.

    ```
    /network-check.sh
    ```

    You will see output like this where `x.x.x.x` is the IP address is `EXTERNAL_LB_IP` address.
    ```
    Wed Mar 12 16:40:18 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:40:19 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:40:20 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:40:21 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Egress traffic from the `workload-vm` is routed to the internal load balancer's forwarding rule.  The VM-Series inspects and translates the request to the `outbound` forwarding rule on the external load balancer. 

4. Login to the VM-Series firewalls using the `VMSERIES_ACTIVE` and `VMSERIES_PASSIVE` output values.

5. After login, take note of the HA Status in the bottom right corner on each firewall.

    <b>Active Firewall</b></br>
    <img src="images/image1.png" width="350">

    <b>Passive Firewall</b></br>
    <img src="images/image2.png" width="350">

6. Perform a user initiated failover.
   1. On the ***Active Firewall***, go to the **Device → High Availability → Operational Commands**.
   2. Click **Suspend local device for high availability**.
        <img src="images/image3.png" width="630">
   3. When prompted, click **OK** to initiate the failover.</br>
        <img src="images/image4.png" width="285">

7. You should notice your SSH session to the `workload-vm` is still active.  This indicates the session successfully failed over between the VM-Series firewalls.
    ```
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:18 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:19 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:21 UTC 2023 -- Offline
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:22 UTC 2023 -- Offline
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:23 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    Wed Mar 12 16:47:24 UTC 2023 -- Online -- Source IP = x.x.x.x
    ```

## (Optional) Onboard Internet Applications
You can secure multiple internet facing applications through the VM-Series firewall. This is done by mapping the addreses/ports from external forwarding rules to NAT policies defined on the VM-Series firewall.

In this section, onboard a new web application by creating a forwarding rule on the external load balancer along with a corresponding NAT policy on the VM-Series. 


### Create an application VM
In Cloud Shell, deploy new virtual machine (`app-vm`) to a subnet within the trust VPC network.  The `app-vm` installs a simple web application through its metadata startup script (`/scripts/app_startup.sh`).

1. In Cloud Shell, set environment variables for your `PROJECT_ID`, `REGION`, `ZONE`, & `SUBNET` for the application environment.

    <p><pre>
    export <i><b>PROJECT_ID</b>=YOUR_PROJECT_ID</i>
    export <i><b>REGION</b>=YOUR_REGION</i>
    export <i><b>ZONE</b>=YOUR_ZONE</i>
    export <i><b>SUBNET</b>=SUBNET_NAME</i></pre></p>

> [!TIP]  
> The `app-vm` can be deployed to any subnet in the `trust-vpc`, or to any VPC connected & routed to the `trust-vpc` (i.e. VPC peering).


2. Create the `app-vm` virtual machine. 

    ```
    gcloud compute instances create app-vm \
        --project=$PROJECT_ID \
        --network-interface subnet=$SUBNET,no-address \
        --zone=$ZONE \
        --machine-type=n2-standard-2 \
        --image-project=debian-cloud \
        --image-family=debian-11 \
        --metadata startup-script-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/google-cloud-vmseries-ha-tutorial/main/scripts/app_startup.sh
    ```

3. Record the `INTERNAL_IP` address of the new virtual machine.

    **Output**
    <p><pre>
    NAME: app-vm
    ZONE: us-central1-a
    MACHINE_TYPE: f1-micro
    PREEMPTIBLE:
    INTERNAL_IP: <i><b>10.0.2.4</b></i>
    EXTERNAL_IP:
    STATUS: RUNNING</pre></p>

> [!NOTE]
> In the VM-Series NAT policy, the `INTERNAL_IP` will be set as the **translated packet's** destination address.  


### Create Forwarding Rule
Create a forwarding rule (`fwd-rule-app-vm`) on the external load balancer.  This rule will be used to distribute internet inbound traffic destined to the `app-vm` through the VM-Series untrust interfaces. 

1. Assign the name of the external load balancer's backend service to an environment variable named `EXTERNAL_LB`.

    ```
    export EXTERNAL_LB=$(gcloud compute backend-services list \
        --filter="loadBalancingScheme:EXTERNAL" \
        --format="get(name)")

    echo $EXTERNAL_LB
    ```

2. Create a new forwarding rule on the external load balancer.

    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create fwd-rule-app-vm \
        --load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL \
        --region=$REGION \
        --ip-protocol=L3_DEFAULT \
        --ports=ALL \
        --backend-service=$EXTERNAL_LB
    ```

    
3. Retrieve the forwarding rule's address.

    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe fwd-rule-app-vm \
        --region=$REGION \
        --format='get(IPAddress)'
    ```
    
> [!NOTE]
> In the firewall's NAT rule, the forwarding rule address is set as the **original packet's** destination address.  

### Create NAT Policy
On the VM-Series, create a NAT policy to translate traffic destined the forwarding rule (`fwd-rule-app-vm`) to the internal IPv4 address of the `app-vm` IP address (i.e. `10.0.2.4`).

1. On the *active* VM-Series, go to **Policies → NAT**.  

2. Click **Add** and enter a name for the rule (i.e. `inbound-app-vm`). 

2. Configure the **Original Packet** as follows:

    | Field                   | Value                                                        |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Source Zone**         | `untrust`                                                    |
    | **Destination Zone**    | `untrust`                                                    |
    | **Service**             | `service-http`                                               |
    | **Destination Address** | The forwarding rule's IPv4 adddress (i.e. `34.172.143.223`). |

    <img src="images/nat1.png" width="630">

3. In the **Translated Packet** tab, configure the **Destination Address Translation** as follows:

    | Field                  | Value                                               |
    | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Translation Type**   | `Static IP` or `Dynamic IP`                         |
    | **Translated Address** | The `INTERNAL_IP` of the `app-vm` (i.e. `10.0.2.4`) |

    <img src="images/nat2.png" width="630">

4. Click **OK** to create the rule.

5. Click **Commit** to apply the changes.

6. After the commit completes, access the sample application using the address of the forwarding rule.
    ```
    http://34.172.143.223
    ```
    <img src="images/image5.png" width="400">

7. On the *active* VM-Series, go to **Monitor → Traffic** to view the traffic destined to the `app-vm`. 


## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources you created in this tutorial, delete all the resources when you no longer need them.

1. (Optional) If you did the **Onboard Internet Applications** section, delete the forwarding rule (`fwd-rule-app-vm`) and application VM (`app-vm`).
    
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete fwd-rule-app-vm \
        --region=$REGION \
        --quiet

    gcloud compute instances delete app-vm \
        --zone=$ZONE \
        --quiet
    ```

2. Run the following command to delete the resources.

    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
    
    Enter `yes` to delete the resources.

3. After all the resources are deleted, Terraform displays the following message.

    ```
    Destroy complete!
    ```
